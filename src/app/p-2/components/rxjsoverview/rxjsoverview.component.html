    <h1>RxJs Introduction</h1>
    <p><b style="margin-left: 30px;">RxJS</b> is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences. It provides
        one
        core type, the <b blue>Observable</b>, satellite types (Observer, Schedulers, Subjects) and operators
        inspired
        by Array methods
        (map, filter, reduce, every, etc) to allow handling asynchronous events as collections.</p>

    <p>ReactiveX combines the <b blue> Observer pattern </b> with the <b blue> Iterator pattern</b> and <b
            blue>
            functional programming with collections</b> to fill
        the need for an ideal way of managing sequences of events.</p>

    <p>The essential concepts in RxJS which solve async event management are:</p>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Observable-></b> represents the idea of an invokable collection of future values or events.</li>
            <li><b>Observer-></b>is a collection of callbacks that knows how to listen to values delivered by the <b blue> Observable</b>.</li>
            <li><b>Subscription-></b>represents the execution of an Observable, is primarily useful for cancelling the execution.</li>
            <li><b>Operators-></b>are pure functions that enable a functional programming style of dealing with collections with operations like <b blue> map, filter, concat, reduce, etc</b>.</li>
            <li><b>Subject-></b>is equivalent to an EventEmitter, and the only way of multicasting a value or event to multiple Observers.</li>
            <li><b>Schedulers-></b>are centralized dispatchers to control concurrency, allowing us to coordinate when computation happens on <b blue> e.g. setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame or others</b>.</li>
        </ul>
