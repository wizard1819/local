    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>RxJS is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences. It provides
        one
        core type, the <b appColor>Observable</b>, satellite types (Observer, Schedulers, Subjects) and operators
        inspired
        by Array methods
        (map, filter, reduce, every, etc) to allow handling asynchronous events as collections.</p>

    <p>ReactiveX combines the <b appColor> Observer pattern </b> with the <b appColor> Iterator pattern</b> and <b
            appColor>
            functional programming with collections</b> to fill
        the need for an ideal way of managing sequences of events.</p>
